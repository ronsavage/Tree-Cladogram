	- No code changes.
	- Fix my licence (sic) mess so all references are to Perl. This involves edits to Makefile.PL
		and LICENSE. See RT#113949. Thanx Kent Fredric.
	- Fix Makefile.PL so modules only used for testing are in TEST_REQUIRES and not PREREQ_PM.
		See RT#113948. Thanx Kent Fredric.
	- Fix README so it more-or-less conforms to the Perl Foundation's guidelines at
		http://www.perlfoundation.org/cpan_licensing_guidelines.

	- Disable testing images in t/test.t because some CPAN testers have installed Imager without
		support for *.ttf fonts. So, a group of tests have been commented out.
	- Remove t/FreeSansBold.ttf, t/wikipedia.01.clad and wikipedia.01.png from the disto.
		There is no point in shipping these files now that they can't be used.
