Revision history for Perl extension Tree::Cladogram.

1.03  2016-08-14T11:33:00
	- Stop using Test::Stream. Use Test::More shipped in the Test::Simple distro.
		See RT#116931. Thanx to Chad Granum aka EXODIST.
	- Update version #s in pre-reqs.
	- Adopt new repo structure. For details, see
		http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html.
	- Update .gitignore and MANIFEST.SKIP.
	- Add File::Spec and File::Temp to TEST_REQUIRES within Makefile.PL.

1.02  2016-04-25T09:26:00
	- No code changes.
	- Fix my licence (sic) mess so all references are to Perl. This involves edits to Makefile.PL
		and LICENSE. See RT#113949. Thanx Kent Fredric.
	- Fix Makefile.PL so modules only used for testing are in TEST_REQUIRES and not PREREQ_PM.
		See RT#113948. Thanx Kent Fredric.
	- Fix README so it more-or-less conforms to the Perl Foundation's guidelines at
		http://www.perlfoundation.org/cpan_licensing_guidelines.

	- Disable testing images in t/test.t because some CPAN testers have installed Imager without
		support for *.ttf fonts. So, a group of tests have been commented out.
	- Remove t/FreeSansBold.ttf, t/wikipedia.01.clad and wikipedia.01.png from the disto.
		There is no point in shipping these files now that they can't be used.
